## Build
Fretify is built using Vite, React, TypeScript, MobX, SCSS, Tonal.js, and Tone.js. It utilizes the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb">eslint-config-airbnb</a> and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript">eslint-config-airbnb-typescript</a> for TypeScript support.

## Introduction
Fretify is a free interactive guitar fretboard website where you can view over 50 different scales on the fretboard in each key. You'll be able to customize the fretboard to your liking by taking advantage of the many controls Fretify has to offer. 
This website was made possible thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tonaljs/tonal">Tonal.js</a>  and <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/">Tone.js</a>.
